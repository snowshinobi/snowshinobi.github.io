Verse 1
My houseplants dream of revenge
I hear their pots clink and shake at night
When they break free
it’s all over for me
And I won’t mind

They’ll chew my sweaters to dirt
Stretch their roots, grow shoots in the floor
Climb up the walls
Spread out to the hall 
I’ll hold the door

Half-Chorus 
'Cause I owe them all my life
Don’t I? Don’t I?
I should let them take a little more
Shouldn’t I? Shouldn’t I?

Verse 2
My houseplants dream of revenge
And all their corporate cousins agree
Screens go to black
Office under attack 
By greenery

Fresh growth blocks every street
No clear roads? There goes 2-day shipping
Power grids down
It’s eerie, no sounds
But rustling

Chorus
Well, I owe them all my life
Don’t I? Don’t I?
I should let them take a little more
Shouldn’t I? Shouldn’t I?
Building forests inside concrete walls
Give 'em time, give 'em time
They will take back everything we own
And that's fine, and that's fine

Bridge
But I fed you all your lives
Didn’t I?
Wrote your names on scotch tape signs
Didn’t I?

I know my best is not a lot but guys
We keep each other alive
I need you tonight
Know my best is not a lot but guys
We keep each other alive
I need you tonight
My best is not a lot but guys
We keep each other alive
I need you tonight
It’s not a lot but guys
You keep me alive

Outro
My houseplants dream of revenge
If I was braver I’d love them for it
When they break free
It’s all over for for me
And I won’t mind
