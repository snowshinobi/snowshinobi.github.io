"You're a virgo, aren't you?"

there's just some people who'll never be ghosts.
this poet i know, she's buried a thousand lifetimes. 

she makes me think twice about time splitting off 
like loose change or shrapnel, 'cause she's got

that cowboy-hat-tipped-low vibe and
wears sun-gold sweaters in Tacoma rain

and it takes hands to flip a card
or plot a star's path or load a pistol.

you have to wonder where all that conviction comes from.
it's something cosmic. something outta my grasp,

some sparkling flask on a shelf i don't reach for.
