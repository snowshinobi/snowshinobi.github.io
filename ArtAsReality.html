<p class="indented" style="text-indent: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>The Overstory</em> by Richard Powers is, as indicated by its title, a text concerned with scale. Just as a forest&rsquo;s worth of trees contribute to the foliage layer called an overstory, this novel reveals the spider-silk threads connecting its nine human characters to the ecosystems surrounding them. Although they are presented using human understandings of time, these connections frequently break up their own chronological flow, dropping in snippets of foresight that only fall into place tens of pages after they are first mentioned. An Irrealist reader takes this to mean that human chronology is not the metric by which time is organized in <em>The Overstory</em>. What drives each character&rsquo;s self-discovery and growth, what drives their budding understanding of the ecological big picture, is unique to each of them; hence the gaps between each character&rsquo;s emotional, physical, and spiritual interpretations of the natural world. For Nicholas Hoel, the mechanism behind his transformation from Iowa farm boy to direct-action ecological activist is his artwork. Nick&rsquo;s entire life is his ultimate &ldquo;performance piece,&rdquo; dotted with individual works that foretell the causes he will someday create for long before Nick becomes aware of it.</span></p>
<p class="indented" style="text-indent: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After losing his immediate family to carbon monoxide poisoning, young adult Nick finds himself heartbroken and purposeless. When the storyline of Olivia, a college dropout spurred to action by the spirits of redwood trees that only she can hear, intersects with Nick&rsquo;s, he is living on life insurance policies and creating art for the sole purpose of giving it away. What Nick draws are interpretations of the seventy-six year&rsquo;s worth of photographs his ancestors have taken of the landmark chestnut tree by the farm, the Hoel Chestnut. This tree is what compelled Olivia to make a stop on her spirit-lead road trip; she senses that &ldquo;someone planted it here a very long time ago simply to attract her attention&rdquo; (Powers 173). Nick&rsquo;s admiration of this tree, his compulsion to draw it in ever-increasing renditions despite the hopelessness pervading his life, is no coincidence. The first thread connecting Nick to Olivia, whose forest-saving quest he will become a significant part of, is the tree Nick spent his childhood sketching the branches of. Charmed by Olivia&rsquo;s conviction, Nick agrees to join her. The duo buries his remaining artwork on the farm property before continuing on the journey that takes them, eventually, to the Life Defense Force environmental justice group defending the redwoods of Oregon.</span></p>
<p class="indented" style="text-indent: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>The Overstory</em> is a tale as concerned about the world at large as it is about the individual lives of each and every organism in the ecological web. Not everything can, or should, be understood by people, ourselves included. Humans destroy and create, suffer in silence and reach out to help. Nick Hoel is one human of nine. Or, more accurately, Nick is one fictional human out of 7 billion real ones (and trillions of other fictional ones). But if his art can provide him a space to paint a warmer future he doesn&rsquo;t yet know will be his, if it can compel him to plant trees that spell a word synonymous with resilience, then one more way to read <em>The Overstory</em> is as an encouragement to keep creating, keep reaching, keep trying. At best, humanity may be able to slow down the speed of the planet&rsquo;s ecological tailspin: a performance piece that requires an entire species to pull off. </span></p>
