<p><u><strong><span style="font-size: 120%; color: #00997a;"><em>The Covenant Between God, Nature, and Humanity: Finding 
Environmentalist Methodology in Regenerative Faith</em></span></strong></u></p>
</center>
<p class="indented" style="text-indent: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bible is, among many things, a story of devotion. Bound by covenant to their God, the Israelites weather physical and psychological assaults alike by holding onto&mdash;and, when they let go, reaching out again for&mdash;their faith. God, in turn, chooses his people again and again. Thousands of years removed from this Biblical timeline, humanity maintains an equally celebratory and equally yet devastating connection: that which binds us to the natural world. Old Testament metaphors and New Testament parables offer unexpected, poignant parallels to our current attempts to curb ecological damage without contributing to decades of environmentally racist policy. By tying descriptions of God and his divine power to natural imagery, the Bible invites a second reading of the covenant between God and Abraham; it can be viewed, on a larger scale, as a covenant between nature and humanity. In all the ways God proved he could grow and change, so can humanity renew its strained contract with ourselves and our climate.</span></p>
<p class="indented" style="text-indent: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout the Bible, God is realized through natural imagery. Having told Elijah to witness him as he passes by, God conjures &ldquo;a great wind&rdquo; which tore apart mountains, &ldquo;an earthquake,&rdquo; &ldquo;a fire,&rdquo; followed by the &ldquo;sound of sheer silence&rdquo; (<em>HarperCollins Study Bible</em>, 1Ki 19:11-12). The text clarifies that, although these powerful phenomena function as evidence of God, &ldquo;the Lord was not in the wind ... not in the earthquake ... not in the fire.&rdquo; Each individual display alone cannot fully encapsulate divinity&mdash;they are facets of God, particularly fierce facets. God&rsquo;s presence is also described with far gentler imagery. Soon before his betrayal by Judas, Jesus admires the &ldquo;tender&rdquo; branches of blooming fig trees: &ldquo;when you see these things taking place, you know that he is near, at the very gates&rdquo; (Mark 13:28-29). Even this sweet description carries an undertone of sadness; the same tree that grows fresh leaves and fruit must eventually drop them. In kind, Jesus&rsquo; duty to humanity requires his sacrifice in their stead. Such is the nature of divinity; chaotic and contradictory, it resists human comprehension. Hence Sallie McFague&rsquo;s observation that metaphor &ldquo;is the <em>dominant</em> language of the New Testament&rdquo;&mdash;and, I would argue, abundant in the Old Testament in the form of natural representations of God (McFague 268). As a connective device, metaphor allows one to understand the unknown by linking it to the familiar. Nature is, for both the characters within and the author(s) of the Bible, the closest experience to divinity that human minds can pinpoint.</span></p>
<p class="indented" style="text-indent: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Historical literary and arts movements support this connection. Chronicling the shifting relationship between humans and their environment, Nash highlights the way American Romanticism rebranded colonist&rsquo;s previously antagonistic views of their harsh landscape. Mountains that they once viewed as &ldquo;blisters&rdquo; upon &ldquo;cursed and ungodly&rdquo; land became &ldquo;wise&rdquo; sources of divine design that study of astronomy and physics could uncover (Nash 44-45). What began as fear of nature&rsquo;s vastness&mdash;the &ldquo;pious&rdquo; sense of &ldquo;terrible awe&rdquo; writers like Henry David Thoreau experienced&mdash;shifts towards a &ldquo;much more comfortable, almost sentimental demeanor,&rdquo; as William Cronon points out (Cronon). The majesty of wilderness&mdash;both its terrifying might and its nostalgic beauty&mdash;is a conduit through which these early Americans felt they experienced closeness with divinity. God may not be nature, but nature is his oldest and most visceral signifier. Within the limits of human perception, these two forces overlap to such an extent that they operate as one and the same. God knows how powerful association and symbolism is to his human creations; it is why he chooses impossible natural wonders as proof of his meeting with Moses: a staff that turns into a snake, leprosy that turns Moses&rsquo; hand &ldquo;as white as snow&rdquo; before it is undone, and Nile water that turns to blood when poured upon the ground (Ex: 4:3-9). Faced with these miraculous signs, &ldquo;the people believed&rdquo; Moses&rsquo; message that God was going to free them from Egyptian enslavement (Ex 4:31). The kind of nature manipulation only God could perform&mdash;manipulation that the Pharaoh's magicians try and fail to replicate&mdash;stands in as suitable proof of God.&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="indented" style="text-indent: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This regenerative potential resonates beyond the Biblical text, through Bullard&rsquo;s rallying cry against systemic and environmental racism, through Cronon&rsquo;s emphasis on the need for wilderness-humanity balance, right to the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">hesed</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> core of any well-worn covenant. Within the pages of the Bible, the faithful find strength in reaching out towards a God who guides, admonishes, and learns from them as well. This narrative of deep reflection, of valuing storytelling, of radically broadening barriers to forgiveness and insight, is one environmentalism can draw strength from. The path to successful, inclusive, antiracist ecological healing is paved not with perfection or pessimism but with reparations, reckoning, and hope. </span></p>
