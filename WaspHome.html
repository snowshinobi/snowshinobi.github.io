<p><strong><span style="font-size: 120%; color: #003333;">Taking the Wasp Home</span></strong></p>
</center>
<p class="indented" style="text-indent: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dizzy and panting, Elis is prepared for death. Itchy grass grabs onto his shorts, his sneakers, his sweat-drenched T-shirt. The sun presses down on every inch of his body. The blue blobs that have been swirling around his eyes spin faster. Elis drops a clammy hand over his eyes and braces himself for the end.</span></p>
<p class="indented" style="text-indent: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Are you dying?" a voice asks. It sounds like it's coming from above him. Elis struggles to remember what God's flying helpers are called. He doesn't remember, but in case it's one of them, he puts on his Best Behavior Voice</span>.</p>
<p class="indented" style="text-indent: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">"It's ok," he says. "I wanna see the good place."</span></p>
<p class="indented" style="text-indent: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">"What good place?" the voice wants to know. It sounds closer to him now. Elis lowers his arm and cracks his eyes open.</span></p>
<p class="indented" style="text-indent: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The kid staring down at him has an acorn-shaped face: short, fluffy hair and a softly pointed chin. Her eyes are acorny brown, too. The red and gold racket in her hands it at an odd angle, at least from Elis's position on the ground. It looks like she's holding it level. He sits up, rubbing bits of grass off his elbows. </span></p>
<p class="indented" style="text-indent: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">"You're playing tennis?" he asks, looking from racket to face and back again. Acorn girl raises her eyebrows. The racket stays level.</span></p>
<p class="indented" style="text-indent: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Yeah," she says, after a pause. Elis bites the inside of his cheek. </span></p>
<p class="indented" style="text-indent: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Why're you&mdash;what's that?" He can make out something on the racket face, carefully balanced across two closely woven strings. Six legs curl into a limp heap over a narrow, black, segmented body. Half of one wing is missing. The head, flat and pointy, lies still.</span></p>
<p class="indented" style="text-indent: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">"What's that," he says again, wary and curious. </span></p>
<p class="indented" style="text-indent: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">"What's it look like," Acorn girl says. "A funeral barge." </span></p>
<p class="indented" style="text-indent: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elis considers the unfamiliar phrase. Funerals are when everyone wears heavy black clothes and puts on their Sad Faces. Dad and Tanya had to stay behind because Tanya was sick. It was important for mom to go, Elis remembers. Dad had wanted him to go too. Even when someone isn&rsquo;t here anymore, Dad told him, we love them. So Elis put on the stiff clothes he didn&rsquo;t like and held mom's hand and tried not to look directly at anyone, because once he did, they&rsquo;d bend down to crush him in a hug or grip his shoulder too hard. He also tried not to look at anyone because he wasn&rsquo;t sure if his Sad Face was sad enough. He&rsquo;d practiced it the plane window and in the mirror in Aunt Andy's bathroom, but he still wasn&rsquo;t sure about it.</span></p>
<p class="indented" style="text-indent: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barges are boats&mdash;really big ones, like the pink dragon candy boat in Willy Wonka&rsquo;s chocolate factory. The Vikings had them too. It takes a lot of people to paddle them and one person to stand at the front in a fancy coat and shout things. Elis would like to stand at the front of a barge and shout things. He'd been torn between asking for an oar and a soccer ball last Christmas. He&rsquo;d decided on the soccer ball since he could play with that in bed. An oar without water isn't really good for much. He could've poked Missy with it, but mom would&rsquo;ve gotten mad. Missy is old and gets scared when you do that, she would&rsquo;ve said. That's what she said about popping bottle caps and hiding the water gun inside Missy's hamburger bed. Missy doesn&rsquo;t look scared. She looks tired. It's nice when she&rsquo;s tired in Elis' lap, but the rest of the time she&rsquo;s kind of boring. </span></p>
<p class="indented" style="text-indent: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Putting two and two together, a funeral barge must be a huge boat full of sad people. Elis gives Acorn girl a look. </span></p>
<p class="indented" style="text-indent: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">"But you aren&rsquo;t wearing any black. And you don&rsquo;t have a big boat."</span></p>
<p class="indented" style="text-indent: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a metaphor,&rdquo; she says, looking off towards the chain-link fence at the end of the field. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t decided where we&rsquo;re going yet.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="indented" style="text-indent: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;You should take him down the slide,&rdquo; Elis offers eagerly, before remembering funerals are supposed to be sad. &ldquo;You could go down really slow. Put your feet flat against the sides, like this.&rdquo; Elis touches his knees together and spreads his feet apart.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="indented" style="text-indent: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Acorn girl&rsquo;s eyes have tiny versions of the clouds in them. "No," she says, and her voice sounds sleepy, or like she&rsquo;s talking to him through water. &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not time for him to have fun. It&rsquo;s time for him to go home.&rdquo; </span></p>
<p class="indented" style="text-indent: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">"It's ok," he says. "I wanna see the good place."</span></p>
<p class="indented" style="text-indent: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">"It's ok," he says. "I wanna see the good place."</span></p>

<p class="indented" style="text-indent: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Ok," Elis says. He can&rsquo;t see them, but he thinks his eyes are glowing. They glow the rest of the way home. </span></p>
