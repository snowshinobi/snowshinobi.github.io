<p class="indented" style="text-indent: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The appeal of detective fiction is twofold. Not only does it offer an exciting narrative sprinkled with unexpected twists, but it also issues its reader a challenge: can you discover the culprit before the detective reveals them? In essence, detective fiction offers an ordinary reader the extraordinary fantasy of becoming, if only for a few hundred pages, as perceptive as a world-renowned detective. It makes sense that a medium like Interactive Fiction would contain a thriving subcategory of whodunit-themed games. The point of IF is to allow the player to embody a person they are not and experience a world that is vastly different than their own. Interactive Fiction takes detective fiction&rsquo;s premise&mdash;become as brilliant as a famous detective!&mdash;and ups the ante; the only thing more enticing than solving a mystery before the detective is taking on the role of detective yourself.</span></p>
<p class="indented" style="text-indent: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What makes Christopher Huang&rsquo;s spin on detective-IF, a game titled <i>An Act of Murder</i>, so interesting is that it turns the well-loved fantasy of detective fiction on its head. All the parts are there&mdash;the suspicious death, the sketchy characters, holes in alibis and ulterior motives&mdash;but the game&rsquo;s tone and mechanics confine the player within the limitations of real-life detective work. The game makes no effort to hide the repetitive and meticulous procedure most detective fiction glosses over; yet, <i>An Act of Murder</i> won second place at the 13th Annual Interactive Fiction Competition and swept several categories at the 2007 XYZZY awards. Why was this remarkably ordinary and, at times, incredibly frustrating game met with such praise? I theorize that, by immersing the player in the truly mundane aspects of solving crime, Huang serves up a paradoxically <i>authentic</i> detective <i>fantasy</i>. A uniquely realistic take on the genre, <i>An Act of Murder</i> gives detective fiction lovers the experience didn&rsquo;t know they wanted until they got it.</span></p>
<p class="indented" style="text-indent: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;In that case, I promise you she will.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="indented" style="text-indent: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In closing, I want to highlight how well-suited <i>An Act of Murder</i> is to its medium. Huang’s decision to write this story as an Interactive Fiction results in one of the most common pitfalls of the medium to blend right into the story. If a reader gets frustrated with a novel, they can flip to the end and figure out the solution easily. With Interactive Fiction, however, player frustration is usually a puzzle-killer. Spending too much time with no leads can cause players to abandon the game altogether. However, within the realistic-fantasy framework of <i>An Act of Murder</i>, getting stuck in the game lines up perfectly with getting stuck in real-life detective cases. In other words, wandering around Gull Point and the surrounding rocky beach adds to the story instead of breaking it. This game challenges players to not only find as much evidence as possible, but to understand and contextualize that evidence. What pieces are missing? Who do I have the least information about? Which pieces of evidence link to one another, and which prompt further exploration or questioning? These are the kinds of questions detectives in crime fiction brood over in their silly hats and darkened rooms—and these are the same questions actual detectives ponder over their piles of crime scene photos and written statements. Where real life diverts from fiction, here, is who is doing this contextualization work: in novels, it is the author, the one who plans the narrative. In real life, it is the detective who must piece together the story and determine the culprit. So, in the case of a detective-IF, who do these questions fall to? I posit that Huang and the player are equally responsible for them. Huang has laid the groundwork for five different puzzles, but it is the tenacity of the player that results in a successful arrest.</p>
