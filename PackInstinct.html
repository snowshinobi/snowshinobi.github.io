<p><em>Verse 1</em><br />Bad habits, yours<br />Are a racket<br />Plates left by the stairs<br />Come on, get a grip</p>
<p>It's funny, you<br />Never bore me<br />Even though I know<br />All your lines by heart</p>
<p><em>Chorus</em> <br />You cut my hair and call in a breeze<br />Take me from you, take me from me<br />Cut my hair and call in a breeze<br />Take me from you and take me<br />Away</p>
<p><em>Verse 2</em><br />"Prince Hamlet<br /><em>knows</em> he's tragic!" Boy,<br />We're running late<br />Grab your bag, let's go</p>
<p>Too focused, at<br />Least you know it<br />I'm watching your back<br />I'm part of your team</p>
<p><em>Chorus</em><br />I cut your hair, honey in the breeze<br />You double take and grin at me<br />Cut my hair and call in a breeze<br />Take me from you and take me<br />Away</p>
<p><em>Bridge</em><br />Spring/Fall is on my mind<br />I smell it on the rain<br />Spring/Fall is on my mind today</p>
<p>Keep my claws tucked in<br />You notice anyway<br />"Right, it's springtime/autumn soon," you say</p>
<p>I'll explain it once and you will<br />Look up moon phase charts and you will<br />Brush burrs out of fur and you will<br />Linger and you'll love so I will<br />Hug until it hurts, yeah, I will<br />Wrap your ankles tight, yeah, I will<br />Drive us to the lake because it's<br />Springtime/Autumn soon, you say</p>
<p><em>Final Chorus</em><br />You cut my hair and call in a breeze<br />Take me from you, take me from me<br />Cut my hair and call in a breeze<br />Take me from you and take me</p>
<p>I cut your hair, honey in the breeze<br />You double take and grin at me<br />Cut my hair and call in a breeze<br />Take me from you and take me<br />Away</p>
<p>Away<br />Away</p>
